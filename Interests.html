                <br> I like an kinds of travel :
                <br>  by cars, by train & travelling on foot.
                <br>First of all it's always nice to stay 
                <br>in a different place for a average. 
                 <br>Secondly, I'm interested in seeing new sights,
                 <br> exploring different cultures & else.
                  <br>Third, I love to spend time in beautiful places
                  <br> & admire the beauty of the natural attractions
                  <br> like sea,mountains,etc.

                Drawing helps me discover,
                <br> reflect on, and express myself.
                <br>
                It helps me learn about myself.
               <br> It helps me feel more happy and confident, 
               <br>and has given me an extra sense of identity
               <br> and purpose in life.
              <br>It keeps me honest with myself.
              <br> It's how I grow.
